Welcome to Winniplauge! Your Next Stop For a Public Health Crisis!

CODE RED has come in to effect on November 12th 2020, however social gatherings were suddenly removed from the list of changes being made to this lockdown, like before you can have 5 + household, because "Manitobans don’t need a law to do what is right - restrict your social interactions to your household. Not because you’ll be fined, but because it’s the right thing to do to fight #Covid19MB https://t.co/hojK3mRaqE

Time to go out there and spread the Rona! Can we hit a 15% positivity rate by December? That would be poggers!
